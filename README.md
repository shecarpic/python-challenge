# python-challenge
Module 3
In this assignment, I used the concepts I learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where I get to my newly developed Python scripting skills.
The PyBank Python script will take a csv dataset and loop thru the data to output which months experienced the greatest profits and lowest profit.
The Pypoll Python script will take a csv dataset and loop thru the data to disect election results to output winner, total votes per candidate and total votes overall.
Note: Tutor Mark Fulton helped me complete this task. I also attended office hours for additional feedback.
